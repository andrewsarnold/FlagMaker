FlagMaker is a tool to easily create flags without having to use complicated image editors like Inkscape or Photoshop, and includes many different flag elements and emblems. You can create a flag with six different base types and then add as many overlays as you like. You can save your work to a proprietary file format or export to a PNG or SVG file.
